### What is this repository for? ###
	 With a rise in fake news being created and the development of artificial intelligence, the gradually
	 increasing use of AI to make fake news is becoming a problem. Grover is a dual function AI with the 
	 first purpose of generating full length fake articles the purpose of not only testing AIs against the 
	 detection of fake news, but also analyzing the impact/trustworthiness people would put into the AI 
	 generated Articles often finding that the articles written by Grover were more trust than ones 
	 written by human sources. The other part of Grover is focused on detecting the source of fake news. 
	 With a focus on text style articles Grover is not so much a fact checker as it is more an AI/human 
	 discriminator. This part of Grover aims to not necessarily derail fake news, but rather lower the 
	 effects of things like the backfire effect and confirmation which lead people to believing new if it 
	 confirms the things, they already perceive to be true. While testing out the Grover AI, we found that 
	 while it is good at creating articles given certain information, the discrimination part of the service 
	 was not working well with articles made by ChatGPT or other ais and edited by a human. 
	 This repository is for working on a way to imporve on the current Grover System through authentifaication 
	 using a hasheys.
