Our understanding of the significance of nutrition in maintaining gut health is expanding, from learning how to monitor our gut health to consuming a nutritious diet that supports our gut microbiome. But what exactly should this diet consist of?

"The answer is quite straightforward at a general level. ... It's essentially about 'being healthier' and consuming a 'healthy' diet," Dr. Aditya Sreenivasan, a gastroenterologist at Lenox Hill Hospital, recently informed CBS News, emphasizing the importance of whole plant foods.

Sreenivasan typically recommends consuming more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing the intake of processed carbs like sugary beverages and processed and red meats.

To provide further insights, Dr. Kenneth Brown, gastroenterologist and host of The Gut Check podcast, elaborated on four food groups that are beneficial for inclusion in your diet to promote gut and overall health:

Fiber-rich foods

Incorporating a diet abundant in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds can support gut health by encouraging "regular bowel movements and preventing constipation," Brown states.

"Eating fiber-rich foods can also nourish the helpful bacteria in your gut, decreasing inflammation and enhancing overall digestive health," he adds.

Probiotic foods

Probiotic foods like yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut can aid digestion, Brown explains.

"Traditional probiotics may not always endure until they reach the colon, but probiotic foods serve as a carrier to transport natural probiotics to your microbiome where they are most needed," he clarifies. "Regularly consuming probiotic foods can help alleviate inflammation and improve digestive health."

Dr. Shilpa Ravella, transplant gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University, proposes simple alternatives to expand your probiotic food choices, such as choosing sourdough over white bread.

"These are both technically wheat products, but they are two distinct foods," she clarifies.

Polyphenol-rich foods

Polyphenols are molecules present in fruits and vegetables that provide their vibrant color.

"Polyphenols function like prebiotics, which nourish our microbiome. Our microbiome then breaks down polyphenols into smaller molecules that benefit our guts, brains, and immune systems," Brown notes.

Antioxidant-rich foods

Foods high in antioxidants can help decrease inflammation in the body and support overall digestive health, Brown mentions.

"This is because antioxidants neutralize free radicals that cause cell damage," he elaborates. These food options include berries, leafy greens, and dark chocolate.

However, keep in mind that these suggestions may not be suitable for everyone. Individuals with specific conditions such as celiac disease or SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) might require a different, more tailored diet. If you notice a new, worsening, or sudden change in gastrointestinal symptoms, it's time to consult a doctor, as it could indicate food-related sensitivities or other gut-related issues.
