#This code reads to files and then gets the percentage of similar words then it will tell you the different 
#words that was found
#this will be a small sample of what it could be, for this to work fully we would need a database of the news
#we are checking and we would use those to check fake news websites of the same topic


#Need to create two files one named= fakeNews, and the other named= realNews. 
#The realNews will have the info from a credible source
#The fakeNews will have info from a sketchy source

#pyton_code underneth:



import string

# Function to calculate the similarity percentage
def calculateSimilarityPercentage(matchCount, totalCount):
    return (matchCount / totalCount) * 100.0

# Function to split a string into words
def splitStringIntoWords(s):
    # Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase
    s = s.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)).lower()
    # Split the string into words
    return s.split()

# Open the two files
with open('realNews') as file1, open('fakeNews') as file2:
    # Read the contents of the files
    file1Content = file1.read()
    file2Content = file2.read()

# Split the contents of the files into words and stores them
file1Words = splitStringIntoWords(file1Content)
file2Words = splitStringIntoWords(file2Content)

# Find the differences between the two files

# Gets the similarity percentage between the two files
matchCount = len(file1Words) - len(differences)

# Output the results, shows how similiar they are
